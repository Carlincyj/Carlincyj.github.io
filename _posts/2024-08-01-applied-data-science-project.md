## Project Background
Welcome to my ITD214 Github page! In this space, I would be sharing more about my project titled "British Airways: Improving Customer Experience".

Specifically, my team and I have selected the following dataset from Kaggle which contains customer reviews of British Ariways scrapped from airlinequality from the period 2015 to 2023. There are 19 columns in this dataset (refer to the dataset using this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaudharyanshul/airline-reviews
**
Here are the four objectives that we focused on:**
1. To reduce response time by 10% by identifying common complaints through clustering for automation of replies (Yan)
2. To identify areas of customer satisfaction for marketing purposes, to improve business by 10% (Bridget)
3. To analyse review topics for the four different seat types for a more targeted marketing approach, improving business by 10% (Carlin (myself))
4. To reduce negative review sentiments by 10% to improve customer satisfaction and demand (Vivienne)

For my business objective (#3), I aim to make use of Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis to analyse common topics of interest for the four different seat types offered on flights by British airways, so that areas of improvement can be addressed / areas done well can be continued.

### Data Preparation
First, data preparation will be done on this dataset. Prior to my own cleaning, our group has done some data preprocessing on the data. That includes the following:
1. Converting fields into appropriate data types
2. Removal of missing values
3. Conversion to lowercase
4. Removal of punctuation, numbers, stop words and domain stop words
5. N-char less than 3 characters
6. Lemmatization
7. Tokenisation
8. Lemmatization
9. POS Tagging and removal of specific parts of speech

## AI Ethics
Discuss the potential data science ethics issues (privacy, fairness, accuracy, accountability, transparency) in your project. 
For this project, one ethical consideration that would be most straightforward would be the annonymisation of customer reviews. During processing of the dataset, the names of customers were removed to ensure privacy. This ensures that confidentiality was maintained for the study,

Fariness - Topic modelling process (is it proportionate, what is the seat distribution like)
Finally, transparency of project is made clear, as the ways of conducting the analysis were documented step by step and explained in detail. This would allow the audience to be clear of procedure and variables involved. This enables openness between myself and the stakeholders, so that recommendations made subsequently are with basis.
